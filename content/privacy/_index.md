## 3. How We Collect, Use, and Disclose Personal Information From Users Who Download Our Application ##

This Section of the Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and disclose your Personal Information.  In the past twelve months (from the effective date of this version of the Privacy Policy) we have collected the categories of information listed in this section.  California residents and European Economic Area (“EEA”) residents have certain rights regarding our collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information.  California residents should view Section 10 of this Privacy Policy to learn about their rights, and EEA residents should view Section 9.   

### A. Collection of Personal Information ###

In order for you to access the Site, we require you to provide us with certain Personal Information. Personal Information that you provide to us may include, without limitation:

 - Identifiers, such as your IP address. 

 - Geolocation information, such as your time zone and physical location.

 - Internet activity information, such as information regarding your use of our Service, and browser information.  

### B. Use of Personal Information ###

We use the Personal Information that you provide to respond to your questions, provide you the specific services you select and send you emails. We may use your contact data to send you information about Fuzz or our products or Services, to contact you when necessary and in conjunction with your use of certain Services. We may use your Traffic Data to customize and tailor your experience on the Site and Services, in emails and in other communications. You may choose not to provide us with any Personal Information. In such case, you can still access the Site; however, you will not be able to access and use those portions of the Site that require your Personal Information or be able to use our Services.  Additionally:

#### I. Inquiries ####

Subject to the Privacy Policy, if you contact Fuzz, we may use any of the information you submit in connection with your inquiry, or any other information we have collected from you when responding to your inquiries.  

#### II. Email to You ####

If you send us an email, we may use your contact data to send you information to contact you when necessary, including verification email.

### C. Disclosure of Personal Information ###

We share certain categories of information we collect from you in the ways described in this Privacy Policy. We share Personal Information and Traffic Data with other companies and people who assist us by performing core services (such as website hosting, data storage and security, marketing assistance and customer service) related to our operation of the Site. Those business partners and agents shall be bound to uphold the same standards of security and confidentiality that we have promised to you in this Privacy Policy, and they will only use your Contact Data and other Personal Information to carry out their specific business obligations to and to provide you with Site related services. Fuzz may share aggregated demographic information with business partners, and anonymized information with analytics and advertising partners.

Fuzz’s accountability for personal data that it receives in the United States under the EU-US Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, Fuzz remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Fuzz proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

We may transfer information about you to another company in connection with a merger, sale of assets or the business or acquisition by or of Fuzz. If Fuzz, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Fuzz goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Fuzz may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.

Fuzz does not share, sell, rent or trade your Personal Information with any third parties.

We reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, the rights of any third party and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Site or Services, or in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of our Services or members of the public. We also may be required to disclose an individual’s personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

#### I.  Information Collected by Third Parties Not Acting on Behalf of Fuzz ####

Certain content and Services offered to you through our Site and Application are served on websites hosted and operated by a company other than Fuzz ("Third Party Contractor Websites"). Fuzz does not disclose information collected from you to these Third Party Contractor Websites, other than unique device identifiers and information disclosed with your explicit consent, but you should be aware that any information you disclose once you access these other websites is not subject to this Privacy Policy. Fuzz does not endorse and is not responsible for the privacy practices of these Third Party Contractor Websites. You should review the privacy policy posted on any other website to understand how that Third Party Contractor Website collects and uses your personally identifiable information.

### II.  Third Party Websites ###

The Site may contain links to third party websites to which Fuzz has no affiliation.  Fuzz does not share your personal information with those websites and is not responsible for their privacy practices. Some websites may have the look and feel of our Site. Please be aware that this Privacy Policy only covers our Site. Should you decide to visit third party websites, we suggest that you read their privacy policies.

## 4. Grounds for Using Your Personal Information ##

We rely on the following legal grounds to process your Personal Information, namely: 

**Performance of a contract** – If you engage Fuzz Technology, L.L.C, in a contract,, we need to collect and use some of your Personal Information to perform our agreement with you to deliver the Services in accordance with our Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy.

**Consent** – We may also collect, use or disclose some additional Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy subject to your consent.

**Legitimate interests** – Finally, we may use your Personal Information for our legitimate interests to provide and improve our Services. Consistent with our legitimate interests and any choices that we offer or consents that may be required under applicable laws, we may use technical information as described in this Privacy Policy and use personal information for our marketing purposes.


## 5. Opt-in / Opt-out ##

We will provide you with an opt-out choice, or opt-in for sensitive data, before we share your data with third parties other than our business partners or agents, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized.  To request to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, please submit a written request to privacy [at] fuzztechnology [dot] com. 

## 6.  Information Security ##

Fuzz maintains appropriate technical, security and organizational measures to protect your Personal Information against unauthorized or unlawful processing and use, and against theft or disclosure. We use industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software to protect the security of your Personal Information during transmission, which encrypts all of the information you input. Only employees or agents who need personal information to perform a specific job are granted access to it.  All of our employees are kept up to date on our privacy and security practices. While Fuzz uses commercially reasonable means to secure your information, we do not guarantee that your personal information will not be improperly accessed, disclosed, or destroyed by breach of any of our safeguards.

 
## 7.  Access and Retention of Information ##

Pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, EEA residents have the right to obtain our confirmation of whether we maintain personal information relating to you in the United States.  Upon request, we will provide you with access to the personal information that we hold about you.  You may also may correct, amend, or delete the personal information we hold about you.  An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data transferred to the United States under Privacy Shield, should direct their query to privacy [at] fuzztechnology [dot] com.  If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.

Fuzz will retain your information in accordance with your instructions, as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, and as required by applicable law.

## 10. Rights of California Residents ##

California residents have certain rights regarding our collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA” or the “Act”).  To learn how Fuzz collects, uses, and discloses Personal Information, see Section 3 of this Privacy Policy.  For purposes of this “Rights of California Residents” section, the term “Personal Information” means Personal Information under Cal. Civ. Code 1798.140(o).  To the extent that any other provision of this Privacy Policy conflicts a provision of this section, the provision in this section controls as to California residents.  

If you are a California resident, you may:

 - Request that we delete your Personal Information (a “Right to Delete Request”).
 - Opt-out of the sale of your Personal Information (a “Right to Opt-Out Request”).
 - Request information about our collection, use, and disclosure of your information (a “Right to Know Request”), including: 
	- the categories and specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you; 
	- the categories of sources from which we have collected your Personal Information; 
	- the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your Personal Information; 
	- the categories of Personal Information we have sold about you; and
	- the categories of third parties with whom we have shared, disclosed for a business purpose, or sold your Personal Information, and which categories of Personal Information we have sold to which categories of third parties.

We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA.  Consistent with Section 1798.125 of the Act, we may charge users different prices, or provide different levels or quality of goods or services, if the difference is reasonably related to the value of their data.  

### A. “RIGHT TO KNOW” REQUESTS ###

California residents may submit a Right to Know Request through Settings in the Application or by emailing Fuzz at privacy [at] fuzztechnology [dot] com.  California residents may submit two types of Right to Know Requests: 

 - (1) A Request for the specific pieces of information that Fuzz has collected about you in the past twelve months; or 
  - (2) a Request for the categories of Personal Information that Fuzz has collected about you in the past twelve months, and how Fuzz has used and disclose that information.  

When you submit a Right to Know Request, we may ask you to provide certain pieces of information in order to verify your identity, such as your name, email address, and phone number.  We may also use a third-party identity verification service to attempt to verify your identity.    

If Fuzz is able to verify your identity, we will respond to your Right to Know Request by: 

 - (a) providing the requested information; or 
 - (b) explaining why the Act does not require us to provide the requested information.  

If Fuzz is unable to verify your identity, Fuzz will respond by explaining why it cannot verify your identity.  

We will confirm receipt of your Right to Know Request within 10 days and will respond to your Request within 45 days. If a response requires additional time, we will notify you of the basis for the delay and may extend our response period up to an additional 45 days.  If the Act requires us to provide the information requested, we will provide the information free of charge and in a readily useable portable format.  We have no obligation to provide Personal Information to you more than twice in a 12-month period.  If a Request or series of Requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, we may charge a reasonable fee for processing the Request(s), or may refuse to process the Request(s).

### B. “RIGHT TO OPT-OUT” REQUESTS ###

California residents may opt out of the sale of some or all of their Personal Information by clicking the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link located in Settings in our Application or by emailing Fuzz at privacy [at] fuzztechnology [dot] com.  You may be required to provide certain information to verify your identity.  We will only use that information for purposes of processing the Request. 

Within 15 days of receiving a Right to Opt-Out Request, we will:

 - Not sell your Personal Information unless and until you subsequently provide express authorization for the sale of your Personal Information.

 - Notify all third parties to whom we have sold your Personal Information within 90 days prior to our receipt of your Request that you have exercised your Right to Opt-Out, and instruct them not to further sell your Personal Information.

 - Not ask for permission to sell your Personal Information for 12 months after receiving the Request.  

California residents who have opted out of the sale of their Personal Information may opt back into the sale of their Personal Information in Settings in the Application or by emailing privacy [at] fuzztechnology [dot] com. 

### C. “RIGHT TO DELETE” REQUESTS ###

California residents may submit a Right to Delete Request in Settings in the Application or by emailing privacy [at] fuzztechnology [dot] com.  You may request that we delete all or some of your Personal Information.

When you submit a Right to Delete Request, we may ask you to provide certain pieces of information in order to verify your identity, such as your name, email address, and phone number. If Fuzz is able to verify your identity, we will respond to your Request by (a) deleting your Personal Information and, if applicable, directing any of our service providers to delete your Personal Information; or (b) explaining why the Act does not require us to delete your Personal Information.  Fuzz may choose to delete Personal Information by de-identifying, aggregating, or completely erasing the information.  We will specify the manner in which we delete your Personal Information.  

If a Request or series of Requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, we may charge a reasonable fee for processing the Request(s), or may refuse to process the Request(s).

### D. Authorized Agents ###

California residents may submit Right to Know, Right to Opt-Out, and Right to Delete Requests through an authorized agent.  Unless the agent provides Fuzz with a power of attorney executed by the California resident, Fuzz may require the California resident to verify their identity with Fuzz and/or to provide Fuzz with written confirmation of the agent’s authority to make the request.

### E. MINORS ###

Fuzz’s Services, Site and Application are not designed to be used by minors under 16 years of age.  Fuzz does not have actual knowledge that it collects or maintains the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.
