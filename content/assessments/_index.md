Fuzz provides information security assessments for cloud-native companies, to highlight (through a prism of engineering best practices) areas to be improved within a security program. 

This is most often engaged by companies seeking to understand their information security posture, and the controls they have in place with respect to financial, and non-public information-processing systems they control, with an eye towards Service Organization Control certification by an independent third party.

Fuzz experts conduct a bottom-up, external assessment of your organization's infrastructure and its
settings and practices; its current security and site reliability engineering practices; and its data
schemas and structures.

Then, through a series of automated and manual tests, interviews, and architecture and system reviews, we help your organization understand its information security posture.
