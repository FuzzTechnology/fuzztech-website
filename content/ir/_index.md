Companies that scale understand it is imperative to establish organization-wide processes and procedures to respond to and learn from events and incidents on a continuing basis. Fuzz Technology draws on decades of incident response experience to help clients create and manage procsses and procedures to become great at strategic incident response - seamlessly handling incidents as they arise. 

This is not just "security" incidents, but rather incidents - a system goes down, a provide goes dark, performance is reduced, or a security event or incident occurs.  

Security incident response is much more effective when you flex those muscles in the way you work every day.

 - Policies, procedures, and processes
 - Indicent response handling framework
 - IR playbooks
 - Security communications tabletop exercises
 - Security communications playbook and drills
 - Incident retrospcticve procedures and materials

 We will then train your teams in how to use these powerful tools, and help you run incidents until you're ready to have us peel off and take your response program to the next level.
